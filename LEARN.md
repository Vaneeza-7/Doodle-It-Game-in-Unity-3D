## Understanding the Game Concept

At its core, **Doodle It!** is a drawing game where the player helps the character, Rio, navigate through obstacles to collect gems. The game focuses on simple, intuitive drawing mechanics, allowing players to engage with the game creatively.

### Core Mechanics

- **Drawing Paths**: The player draws paths or shapes directly on the screen to guide Rio.
- **Collecting Gems**: The main objective of each level is to collect all gems while avoiding obstacles.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Players must strategize to avoid traps and challenges that can end the game.

## Game Design and Planning

The design process for **Doodle It!** involved several key steps:

1. **Conceptualization**: The idea was to create a game that combined puzzle-solving with creative drawing.
2. **Prototyping**: Early versions were built to test the drawing mechanics and ensure they were intuitive and fun.
3. **Level Design**: Levels were designed with increasing difficulty to challenge players as they progress.
4. **Art and Aesthetics**: The game's visual style was developed to be colorful and engaging, appealing to players of all ages.

## Introduction to Unity 3D

**Unity 3D** is a powerful game development platform used to create **Doodle It!**. Here’s a quick introduction:

- **Unity Editor**: The workspace where game assets, scripts, and scenes are managed.
- **Scripting**: Unity uses C# for scripting, enabling developers to control game mechanics, character behaviors, and more.
- **Assets**: Unity supports importing various assets like models, textures, and sounds, all of which were used to build Doodle It!

## Key Features and Implementation

### Drawing Mechanics

The drawing mechanic was implemented using Unity's **LineRenderer** component, which allows for drawing lines in the game world. Custom scripts handle the player's input to create paths that Rio follows.

### Physics and Obstacles

Unity's built-in physics engine was used to manage collision detection and movement, making the game responsive and realistic. Obstacles were created as physics objects that interact with Rio based on the paths drawn by the player.

### Level Design

Levels were built using Unity's **Scene Manager**, allowing for easy management of different stages and conditions. Each level was designed to introduce new challenges and mechanics, gradually increasing in difficulty.
